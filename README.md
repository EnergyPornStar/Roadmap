# Ethereum Commonwealth Roadmap repository

This repository is used to represent the Ethereum Commonwealth development roadmap.

Each project has the corresponding milestone issue development discussion at the [Roadmap issues](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Roadmap/issues).

If someone has ideas or suggestions, then he should submit a new issue for discussion.

This repository will be the central unit for discussing the technical details of the development of the Ethereum Commonwealth projects.

DEX ICO repository is moved [here](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/ICO).
